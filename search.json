    "text": "Dear Friends and Colleagues,\nWe are pleased to announce that CAAD Futures 2025 will be held at the University of Hong Kong during the first week of July 2025.\nThe theme of CAAD Futures 2025 is ‘Catalytic Interfaces’. This theme reflects our goal to (i) catalyse collaborative and interdisciplinary research initiatives around emergent research priorities, and (ii) provide a platform for local, regional, and international researchers in the field of CAAD to interface.\nYou are receiving this email because you are a research catalyser in the field of computer-aided architectural design research. We would like to invite you to participate our conferences through two routes:\n\nINDIVIDUAL PAPERS ON CATALYTIC RESEARCH\n\nWe invite researchers to submit abstracts by September 9, 2024. Abstracts should be of no longer than 250 words; see appendix for potential topics of research.\nThe submission process includes initial abstract submission and acceptance, followed by two rounds of review. High-quality submissions will be selected for publication by the end of the first review round either as (A) long papers in a Springer publication or as (B) short papers in a companion volume. The selection for these categories will be based on both quality as well as the curation of the conference programme. See A1 for a list of potential paper topics; more details and instructions for submission will follow by mid-August on this website.\n\nTEAM CATALYSERS FOR ‘CATALYTIC INTERFACES’\n\nWe invite interested catalysers to form teams around a topic of inquiry and develop an abstract to be submitted by September 9, 2024 to participate in the special programming of ‘Catalytic Interfaces’. The programme aims to provide both a platform and capacity for researchers to collaboratively catalyse new frontiers in CAAD research. See A2 for a brief description on the special programming.\nBeginning with team formation by interested catalysers, the programme involves a series of online catalyser events to foster productive team pairs/groupings around emergent topic areas, synthesising the interests of the paired teams. During the three-day conference, these larger team will prototype and further develop artefacts to concretise their thesis. These efforts will culminate in a public presentation at the end of the conference, as well as the creation of a manifesto and outcomes published in the conference’s companion publication. An optional Expert Invitation Award will also be offered for outstanding proposals to sponsor the travel of team members or their invitees, aiming to enhance the potential for impactful output.\nSubmissions should include (a) a title; (b) list of team members; (c.i) the topic area(s) related to the team’s core expertise and interests; and (c.ii) several identified areas where the team seeks collaboration via ‘Catalytic Interfaces’; and (d) an abstract of no longer than 500 words that cogently describes a clear research question or thesis that the team wishes to develop through ‘Catalytic Interfaces’. More details and instructions for submission will follow by mid-August on the CAADFutures2025.hku.hk website.\nThank you in advance for your participation, and we very much look forward to welcoming you in Hong Kong next year!\nYours sincerely, CAADFutures 2025 Organising Committee\nProf. Kristof Crolla\nProf. Kam-Ming Mark Tam\nProf. Hongshan Guo\nDr. Garvin Goepel\nMr. Haotian Zhang"

    "text": "Dr. Garvin Goepel is a designer and researcher specializing in integrating Augmented Reality (AR) with generative architecture. Currently a Post-doctoral Fellow and Lecturer at the University of Hong Kong (HKU), he completed his PhD at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) as a Hong Kong PhD Fellowship Scheme awardee. Goepel’s research focuses on collaborative holographic-driven construction, technology-infused craftsmanship, and replacing conventional paper drawing-based communication with holographic instructions. He believes AR can democratize skill through simple, intuitive instructions without professional training. Goepel holds a Master of Architecture with distinction from the University of Applied Arts, Vienna, and has worked with practices such as Coop Himmelb(l)au. He has researched at ETH’s Block Research Group, CUHK, and HKU, published in leading conferences and journals, and taught AR and design workshops internationally. His work includes the mixed-reality artwork “Resonance-In-Sight” for the Hong Kong Museum of Arts. In 2021, he was part of the organizing committee for the 26th International Conference of CAADRIA."

Hosted in Hong Kong, CAAD Futures 2025 will engage with the city’s advanced architectural design and research, as well as the dynamic activities within the Greater Bay Area’s academic and professional communities.\n\nCatalytic Prelude\nAs the conference’s eponymous activity, “CATALYTIC INTERFACE” is an indispensable component of CAAD Futures 2025. It will last throughout the conference and provide a forum for leaders of various domains within the architectural, engineering, and construction sector to catalyse new modalities of architectural creation.\n\n\nCatalysation in Conference\nInspired by the concept of Hackathon, groups of Catalysers are encouraged to prototype and develop an artefact during the three-day conference. An artefact might range from design concepts, to text, to physical artefacts, to software products, etc. This artefact will embody the position of the group regarding the interfacing of topics nourished through the period of discussions leading up to the conference.\n\n\nCatalytic Climax\nOn the final day of the conference, the groups of Catalysers will present their artefacts as well as their refined positions. This event will be open to the public at large, facilitating exchange and dissemination.\nThe outcome of the conference is two-fold: a manifesto featuring the condensed positions of all Catalysers and the opportunity for interested Catalysers to publish the outcome of their three-day collaboration through a peer-reviewed book by the University of Hong Kong Press. A dedicated open access platform will be set up to host all assets developed during the period to complement both works.\nJoin CAAD Futures 2025 in exploring and expanding the transformative potential of “Catalytic Interfaces”."
