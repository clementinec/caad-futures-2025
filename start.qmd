## Conference Theme
### Catalytic Interfaces
The theme for the CAAD Futures 2025 - Hong Kong Conference is “CATALYTIC INTERFACES”.

"Catalytic Interfaces" focuses on the transformative role computation plays in the interfaces surrounding architectural design and production. Whether methodological, spatial, interdisciplinary, technological, ecological, communicational, or cultural—interfaces act as catalysts, introducing alternative mechanisms that facilitate more efficient, diverse, or radical processes, demonstrating a significant shift when compared to traditional methods.

The theme highlights how these interfaces grant access to extensive datasets and computational resources, enabling deeper levels of exploration, complexity, and interaction between designers and the built environment. This access fosters the rapid generation of architectural and urban designs by leveraging large data volumes.

CAAD Futures 2025 aims to catalyse critical discussions on the implementation and impact of these catalytic interfaces within the architectural profession. The conference will address current and future challenges and opportunities for computation in architecture design and production, emphasising the potential for increased multidisciplinary collaboration and integration across various stakeholders.

## Key Features
### Keynote Lectures
The conference will feature four keynote lectures by world-leading figures from a range of fields related to the conference theme.

### Panel Discussions
Following each keynote lecture, there will be panel discussions with domain pioneers to provide alternative angles and in-depth thinking.

### Paper Presentations
The conference will include paper presentation sessions over three days, consisting of both peer-reviewed papers and speaker-driven sessions.

### Lunch Discussions
Two thematic lunchtime discussions will explore significant social concerns through the lens of CAAD research, focusing on diversity & inclusion and wealth & equity.

### Evening Programs
Several evening events, including cocktail events and a closing banquet, will provide opportunities for networking and informal discussions.

### Post-Conference Tours
A series of architecture and industry-related educational tours will be organized to showcase noteworthy highlights from Hong Kong and the region.
