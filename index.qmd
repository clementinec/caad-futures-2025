Dear Friends and Colleagues,

We are pleased to announce that CAAD Futures 2025 will be held at the University of Hong Kong during the first week of July 2025.

The theme of CAAD Futures 2025 is _‘Catalytic Interfaces’_. This theme reflects our goal to (i) catalyse collaborative and interdisciplinary research initiatives around emergent research priorities, and (ii) provide a platform for local, regional, and international researchers in the field of CAAD to interface.

You are receiving this email because you are a research catalyser in the field of computer-aided architectural design research. We would like to invite you to participate our conferences through two routes:


<h4 style="text-align: center;">INDIVIDUAL PAPERS ON CATALYTIC RESEARCH</h4>

We invite researchers to submit abstracts by `September 9, 2024`. Abstracts should be of no longer than 250 words; see appendix for potential topics of research.

The submission process includes initial abstract submission and acceptance, followed by two rounds of review. High-quality submissions will be selected for publication by the end of the first review round either as (A) long papers in a Springer publication or as (B) short papers in a companion volume. The selection for these categories will be based on both quality as well as the curation of the conference programme. See [A1](conference_theme.qmd) for a list of potential paper topics; more details and instructions for submission will follow by mid-August on this website.


<h4 style="text-align: center;">TEAM CATALYSERS FOR ‘CATALYTIC INTERFACES’</h4>

We invite interested catalysers to form teams around a topic of inquiry and develop an abstract to be submitted by September 9, 2024 to participate in the special programming of ‘Catalytic Interfaces’. The programme aims to provide both a platform and capacity for researchers to collaboratively catalyse new frontiers in CAAD research. See A2 for a brief description on the special programming.

Beginning with team formation by interested catalysers, the programme involves a series of online catalyser events to foster productive team pairs/groupings around emergent topic areas, synthesising the interests of the paired teams. During the three-day conference, these larger team will prototype and further develop artefacts to concretise their thesis. These efforts will culminate in a public presentation at the end of the conference, as well as the creation of a manifesto and outcomes published in the conference’s companion publication. An optional Expert Invitation Award will also be offered for outstanding proposals to sponsor the travel of team members or their invitees, aiming to enhance the potential for impactful output.

Submissions should include (a) a title; (b) list of team members; (c.i) the topic area(s) related to the team’s core expertise and interests; and (c.ii) several identified areas where the team seeks collaboration via ‘Catalytic Interfaces’; and (d) an abstract of no longer than 500 words that cogently describes a clear research question or thesis that the team wishes to develop through ‘Catalytic Interfaces’. More details and instructions for submission will follow by mid-August on the CAADFutures2025.hku.hk website.

Thank you in advance for your participation, and we very much look forward to welcoming you in Hong Kong next year!

Yours sincerely, CAADFutures 2025 Organising Committee\
